- This program allows the user to input fractions and performs
- multiple operations on them, such as addition, subtraction,
- multiplication, and division. It also enables users to compare
- fractions and raise them to a specified power. The program handles
- invalid input gracefully, allowing for repeated entries if needed.

- How to Run: Compile and execute the main.cpp and fraction.cpp file. 
- Input fractions in the format "A/B" where A is the numerator and B is the denominator.
*****************************************************************
Input Format:
- The program expects fractions in the format "numerator/denominator".
-  If a whole number is provided, the program will interpret it as "whole_number/1". Invalid input, such as zero denominators, will result in an error. Filenames:
This program uses the following files:
- fraction.h: Header file containing the class definition and function declarations for the Fraction class. - fraction.cpp: Source file implementing the functions defined in fraction.h.
